Hello, my name is James Triveri. I'm the head of Data Science at Dellwood Insurance, an E&S lines insurance company specializing 
in commercial property and casualty coverage for small and middle-market business risks. My primary interests are Machine 
Learning/Deep Learning, Numerical Linear Algebra, Geospatial Data Science and Scientific Computing. I serve as a Computer Science 
instructor at Des Moines Area Community College (DMACC) teaching programming and Data Science courses. I'm also a member of DMACC's 
AI advisory committee. 

I am an ardent supporter of Free Software, as well as a long-time user and advocate of the Python programming language. I'm an active contributor to 
Open Source, and maintain a few projects of my own. You can check out my GitHub page [here](https://github.com/jtrive84).

I graduated from Augustana College in Rock Island, Illinois where I studied Mathematics and Physics, and received an M.S. in Computer Science from the 
Georgia Institute of Technology specializing in Machine Learning.

My CV is available [here](resume.pdf).

Thanks for checking in!

JT
