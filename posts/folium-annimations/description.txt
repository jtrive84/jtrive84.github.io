Everyone loves folium. It is an incredibly powerful and versatile tool for interactive 
map creation, providing users the ability to visualize geospatial data in a 
click-able, zoom-able interface in just a few lines of Python.

A folium capability that I was unaware of until recently is the ability to
create animations of geospatial phenomena that evolve over time, such as
vehicle trajectories, satellites, pedestrian traffic or changes in weather patterns.
This is facilitated via the TimestampedGeoJson plugin, which works by leveraging
Leaflet.jsâ€™s leaflet-timestamped extension, providing controls for play, pause, and 
speed adjustment. When added to a folium map, it animates the change of geospatial 
data over time.

In this article, I walkthrough how to create an animation of the position of the 
International Space Station relative to the surface of the Earth every minute for 
an hour using folium and the TimestampedGeoJson extension.
