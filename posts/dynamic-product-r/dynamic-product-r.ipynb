    "## Using `Reduce` and `%like%`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Reduce` function successively applies a function to the elements of an object from left to right or right to left, \n",
    "respectively. The simplest example is using `Reduce` in place of `sum`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```R\n",
    "> Reduce(`+`, c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5))\n",
    "[15]\n",
    "```\n",
    "We can also replicate `prod`\n",
    "\n",
    "```R\n",
    "> Reduce(`*`, c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5))\n",
    "[1] 120\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`Reduce`  is capable of working with more complex data structures as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `%like%` function comes from data.table, and works similar to SQL's `LIKE` operator. It is essentially shorthand for \n",
    "a regular expression pattern matching subroutine, which returns a TRUE/FALSE based on whether or not the target matches \n",
    "the pattern. To demonstrate, we identify which month names end in `y`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```r\n",
    "> month.name %like% \"y$\"\n",
    "[1]  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE\n",
    "```\n",
    "To return the actual month names ending in `y`, use the previous expression as a mask:\n",
    "\n",
    "```r\n",
    "> month.name[month.name %like% \"y$\"]\n",
    "[1] \"January\"  \"February\" \"May\"      \"July\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in regular expression parlance, `$` means to match `y` only when it occurs at the end of the string. Similarly, \n",
    "`^` indicates the match must occur at the beginning of the string. In addition, `.+`  matches one or more characters, which \n",
    "can be letters, numbers, punctuation or whitespace. We can leverage `Reduce` and `%like%` within the context of data.table \n",
    "to take the product of a potentially variable number of factor columns. Using our latest version of DF with \n",
    "3 `prop_*_factor` columns, we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "```r\n",
    "DF[,prop_factor:=\n",
    "    Reduce(`*`, .SD), .SDcols=names(DF)[names(DF) %like% \"^prop.+factor$\"]\n",
    "    ]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To break this down a bit, note that the value assigned to `.SDcols` is doing nothing more than filtering to only those \n",
    "columns starting with `prop` and ending with `factor`. We can see this by running the expression in isolation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```r\n",
    "> names(DF)[names(DF) %like% \"^prop.+factor$\"\n",
    "[1] \"prop_tiv_factor\"        \"prop_age_bld_factor\"    \"prop_deductible_factor\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`.SD` is one of data.table's *special symbols*, which serve as shortcuts for frequently used operations.\n",
    "In this particular case, `.SD` is a stand-in for the columns we're interested in taking the product of,\n",
    "and `.SDcols` represents the names of the columns over which the operation is to be applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "In data.table, `:=` represents the \"assignment-by-reference\" operator. Notice that when a column is defined via `:=`, the \n",
    "update is made by reference, so it isn't necessary to re-assign the column name to the table as would typically be \n",
    "necessary when working with standard data.frame objects. \n",
    "\n",
    "Does our solution generalize to any number of columns? Let's add a few more factors and test it out:\n",
    "\n",
    "```R\n",
    "DF = data.table(\n",
    "    policyno=paste0(\"0000\", 1:5), locationno=rep(1, 5), \n",
