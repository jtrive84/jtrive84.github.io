    "The Python multiprocessing library exposes an interface that simplifies distributing tasks to multiple cores. The `multiprocessing.Pool` class provides \n",
    "access to a pool of worker processes to which jobs can be submitted. It supports asynchronous results with timeouts and callbacks and has a parallel map \n",
    "implementation. Leveraging `multiprocessing.Pool` is straightforward. To demonstrate, we will solve Project Euler Problem #14 in a distributed fashion. \n",
    "The problem states:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "The following iterative sequence is defined for the set of positive integers:\n",

    "\n",
    "It can be seen that this sequence (starting at 13 and finishing at 1) contains \n",

    "To start, we define two functions: `collatz_test` and `chain_length`. `collatz_test` contains the logic that either divides the input by 2 (if even) or multiplies it by 3 and adds 1 (if odd). `chain_length` returns a tuple consisting of the initial integer along with the length of the collatz chain:\n",

Instead, the array will be created once, and all processes will have access to it. The \"L\" typecode is from the array module in the Python Standard Library, which indicates the datatype of the elements contained in the sequence. We initialize the Pool instance, then call its map method, which works similarly to the builtin map function, only in parallel. Within `pool.map`, We set `chunksize=1000` due to the following commentary in multiprocessing's documentation:\n",
    "\n",
