    "A linear model can be fit by solving closed form equations. In the case of the Gaussian, we can maximize the log-likelihood and find an analytical solution directly. Unfortunately, that cannot be done with most Generalized Linear Models including Poisson regression. Instead, an iterative approach such as Iterative Reweighted Least Squares is used. The model is fit based on one-term Taylor linearization of the log-likelihood function identified as the working response. Given an initial estimate of the parameters $\\hat{\\beta}$, we calculate the estimated linear predictor $Ln(\\hat{\\mu}_{i}) = \\hat{\\eta}_{i} = x_{i}^{T}\\beta$, which is then used to obtain the fitted values $\\hat{\\mu}_{i} = g^{-1}(\\hat{\\eta}_{i}) = exp(\\hat{\\eta}_{i})$.
