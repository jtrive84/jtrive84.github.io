    "Essentially, MLE aims to identify which parameter(s) make the observed data most likely, given the specified model. In \n",
    "practice, we do not know the values of the proposed model parameters but we do know the data. We use the likelihood \n",
    "function to observe how the function changes for different parameter values while holding the data fixed. This can be used \n",
    "to judge which parameter values lead to greater likelihood of the sample occurring. \n",
    "\n",
    "The joint density of $n$ independently distributed observations is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f(\\mathbf{x}|\\boldsymbol{\\beta}) = \\prod_{i=1}^{n} f_{i}(x_{i}|\\beta), \\hspace{0.5em} 1 \\leq i \\leq n.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "When this expression is interpreted as a function of unknown $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$ given known data $x$, \n",
    "we obtain the likelihood function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathcal{L}(\\mathbf{\\beta}|\\mathbf{x}) = \\prod_{i=1}^{n} f_{i}(x_{i}|\\mathbf{\\beta}).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Solving the likelihood equation can be difficult. This can be partially alleviated by logging the likelihood expression, \n",
    "which results in an expression for the loglikelihood. When solving the likelihood, it is often necessary to take the \n",
    "derivative of the expression to find the optimum (although not all optimizers are gradient based). It is much more \n",
    "computationally stable and conceptually straightforward to take the derivate of an additive function of independent \n",
    "observations (loglikelihood) as opposed to a multiplicative function of independent observations (likelihood).\n",
    "The loglikelihood is given by:\n",

    "expression for the joint loglikelihood over the set of observations. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "The function eventually passed along to `optim` will be implemented as a closure. A closure is a function which \n",
    "returns another function. A trivial example would be one in which an outer function wraps and inner function that computes \n",
    "the product of two numbers, which is then raised to a power specified as an argument accepted by the outer function.\n",
    "You'd be correct to think this problem could just as easily be solved as a 3-parameter function. However, \n",
    "you'd be required to pass the 3rd argument representing the degree to which the product should be raised every time the \n",
    "function is called. An advantage of closures is that any parameters associated with the outer function are global variables \n",
    "from the perspective of the inner function, which is useful in many scenarios. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next we implement a closure as described in the previous paragraph: The inner function takes two numeric \n",
    "values, `a` and `b`, and returns the product `a * b`. The outer function takes a single numeric argument, `pow`, which \n",
    "determines the degree to which the product should be raised. The final value returned by the function will \n",
    "be `(a * b)^pow`:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```r\n",
    "# Closure in which a power is specified upon initialization. Then, for each subsequent\n",
    "# invocation, the product a * b is raised to pow. \n",
    "prodPow = function(pow) {\n",
    "    function(a, b) {\n",
    "        return((a * b)^pow)\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To initialize the closure, we call `prodPow`, but only pass the argument for `pow`. We will inspect the result and \n",
    "show that it is a function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```r\n",
    "> func = proPow(pow=3)\n",
    "> class(func)\n",
    "[1] \"function\"\n",
    "\n",
    "> names(formals(func))\n",
    "[1] \"a\" \"b\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "The object bound to `func` is a function with two arguments, `a` and `b`. If we invoke `func` by specifying arguments for \n",
    "`a` and `b`, we expect a numeric value to be returned representing the product raised to the 3rd power:\n",
    "\n",
    "```R\n",
    "> func(2, 4)\n",
    "[1] 512\n",
    "\n",
    "> func(7, 3)\n",

    "### Gamma LogLikelihood\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We next implement the gamma loglikelihood as a closure. The reason for doing this has to do with the way in which `optim` \n",
    "works. The arguments associated with the function passed to `optim` should consist of a vector of the parameters of \n",
    "interest, which in our case is a vector representing $(\\alpha, \\theta)$. By implementing the function as a closure, we can \n",
    "reference the set of observations (`vals`) from the scope of the inner function without having to pass the data as an \n",
    "argument for the function being optimized. This is very useful, since, if you recall from our final expression for the \n",
    "loglikelihood, it is necessary to compute $\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\mathrm{Ln}(x_{i})$ and $\\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}$ at each evaluation. \n",
    "It is far more efficient to compute these quantities once then reference them from the inner function as necessary without \n",
    "requiring recomputation.\n",
