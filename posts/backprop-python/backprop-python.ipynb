    "Backpropagation is a key algorithm used in training fully connected neural networks, also known as feed-forward neural networks. In this algorithm, the network's output error is propagated backward, layer by layer, to adjust the weights of connections between neurons.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](fc.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The process starts by comparing the network's output to the desired output, calculating the error. Then, starting from the output layer and moving backward, the algorithm computes the gradients of the error with respect to each weight in the network using the chain rule of calculus. These gradients indicate how much each weight contributes to the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, the weights are updated using gradient descent, where they are adjusted in the direction that minimizes the error. This adjustment is proportional to the gradient and a predefined learning rate, ensuring the network converges towards a solution. Backpropagation continues iteratively over the training data until the network's performance reaches a satisfactory level or a predetermined number of iterations is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, backpropagation efficiently adjusts the weights of a fully connected network, enabling it to learn complex relationships between input and output data through iterative optimization of the network's parameters.\n",

    "In what follows, we walkthrough the mathematics and pseudocode required to train a 2-layer fully connected network for a classification task.\n",

    "### Forward Pass\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, superscripts represent the layer associated with each variable:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $X = A^{(0)}$: Input data having dimension n-by-f, where n is the number of samples and f the number of features. For a batch of 32 MNIST samples, $X$ would have dimension (32, 784).\n",
    "\n",
    "- $y$: Target variable. classifying a single digit from MINST, a vector populated with 0s and 1s indicating the ground truth label for the sample (8 or not 8). Has the same length as the first dimension of $X$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- $W^{(l)}$: Trainable weights. Projects previous layer activations to lower dimensional representation. Again referring to the first set of weights for a batch of 32 MNIST samples, $W^{(1)}$'s first dimension will match the second dimension of the activations from the previous layer (784), and $W^{(1)}$'s second dimension will be some lower dimension, say 256. $W^{(1)}$ will therefore have dimension (784, 256).\n",
    "\n",
    "- $b^{(l)}$: Bias term, a one-dimensional vector associated with each hidden layer having length equal to the second dimension of the hidden layer. $b^{(1)}$ will have dimension (256,).\n",
    "\n",
    "- $Z^{(l)} = A^{(l-1)} W^{(l)} + b^{(l)}$: Output of layer $l$, which is the matrix product of the previous layer activations $A^{(l-1)}$ and current layer weights (plus bias term). \n",
