    "Pandas is a powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool built on top of the Python programming language. It has become the data manipulation library of choice for Machine Learning and Data Science practitioners. \n",
    "Pandas exposes two powerful data structures: Series objects (roughly akin R vectors) represent indexed, homogeneously-typed data. Series objects have a close affinity with numpy ndarray objects, allowing for straightforward conversion from Series to ndarray objects. DataFrame objects are two-dimensional, size-mutable, potentially heterogeneous tabular datasets. DataFrame's are comprised of one or more Series objects, similar to how a data.frame in R is comprised of one or more vectors. \n",

    "If you research how to connect to a database from Python, many examples use the pyodbc library, which creates a connection to any ODBC-compatible database. However, connections with pyodbc itself are uni-directional: Data can be retrieved, but it cannot be uploaded into the database. To allow for simple, bi-directional database transactions, we use pyodbc along with [sqlalchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/), a Python SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper that gives application developers the full power and flexibility of SQL. With pyodbc and sqlalchemy together, it becomes possible to retrieve and upload data from Pandas DataFrames with relative ease. \n",
    "Let's assume we're interested in connecting to a database running on some known server. A connection using sqlalchemy is created as follows (assuming a SQL Server database):\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "\n",
    "# Initialize connection.\n",
    "conn =  sqlalchemy.create_engine(conn_uri)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A few points to highlight:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* `conn_uri` is a string that contains information needed to connect to our database. The prefix `mssql+pyodbc://` indicates that we're targeting a SQL Server database via the pyodbc connector. Also, if we weren't using Windows authentication, or were working with a different RDBMS, it would be necessary to change `conn_uri`. For example, an Oracle connection uri would be specified as `oracle://[USERNAME]:[PASSWORD]@[DATABASE]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Also in `conn_uri`, within the format substitution, whitespace in `DRIVER` is replaced with `+`. This is consistent with how whitespace is encoded for web addresses. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, to query the French Motor Third-Party Liability Claims sample dataset in the table *SAMPLE_FREMTPL*, use the `read_sql` function. I've included the connection initialization logic for convenience:\n",

    "Instead of passing a query to `pd.read_sql`, the tablename could have been provided. `pd.read_sql` is convenience wrapper around `read_sql_table` and `read_sql_query` which will delegate to the specific function depending on the input (dispatches `read_sql_table` if input is a tablename, `read_sql_query` if input is a query).

    "### Iterative Data Retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with large datasets, it may be inefficient to retrieve the entire dataset in a single pass. Pandas provides functionality to retrieve data in chunksize blocks, which can result in significant speedups. In the following example, the same French Motor Third-Party Liability Claims sample dataset is retrieved in 20,000-record blocks. The only change in the call to `read_sql` is the inclusion of `chunksize`, which specifies the maximum number of records to retrieve for a given iteration. We assume `conn` has already been initialized:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "Using `read_sql`'s *chunksize* parameter for iterative retrieval.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "CHUNKSIZE = 20000\n",
    "SQL = \"SELECT * FROM SAMPLE_FREMTPL\"\n",
    "dfiter = pd.read_sql(SQL, con=conn, chunksize=CHUNKSIZE)\n",
    "df = pd.concat([dd for dd in dfiter])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* `CHUNKSIZE` specifies the maximum number of records to retrieve at each iteration. \n",
    "* `dfiter` is a reference to the data targeted in our query. `dfiter` is not a DataFrame, rather it is a generator, a Python object which makes it easy to create iterators. Generators yield values lazily, so they are particularly memory efficient. \n",
    "* `df = pd.concat([dd for dd in dfiter])` can be decomposed into two parts: First, `[dd for dd in dfiter]` is a *list comprehension*, a very powerful tool that works similar to a flattened for loop. If we bound `[dd for dd in dfiter]` to a variable directly, the result would be a list of 34 DataFrames, each having no more than 20,000 records. \n",
    "Second, `pd.concat` takes the list of DataFrames, and performs a row-wise concatenation of each DataFrame, resulting in a single DataFrame with 678,013 records. `pd.concat` is akin to the SQL `UNION` operator. The final result, `df`, is a DataFrame having 678,013 rows and 12 columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exporting Results to File\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of reading the data into memory, it may be necessary to retrieve the dataset, then write the results to file for later analysis. This can be accomplished in an iterative fashion so that no more than `CHUNKSIZE` records are in-memory at any point in time. Results will be saved to .csv in a file named `\"FREMTPL.csv\"` in 100,000 record blocks:\n",

    "### Exporting Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to export a DataFrame into a database, we leverage the DataFrame's `to_sql` method. We provide the name of the table we wish to upload data in, along with a connection object, and what action to take if the table already exists. \n",
